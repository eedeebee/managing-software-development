Skits, role playing and other scenarios

- Hiring and interviews
- Giving direct feedback when improvement is needed
- Managing someone out
- Rhetoric, tacticss, consensus building and tact and listening in meetings and other communication
- Running an effective standup
- Grooming and planning meetings
- Managing priorities and input from various sources (upper management, your boss, your PM, your designer, your staff, yourself)
	- Understanding context: 
		- state of product, business, customers, your team, your level of knowledge of these thigns
		- bug impact (2 out of 1000 customes for example)
		- often do this collaboratively with input of others if need be (customer support, PM, desitn, your team, execs, etc)
	- Often product orgs will pair you with a PM who is naturally involved in represnting business interests and has large input on priorities
		- Eng often hs quality, reliability, stability, performance, etc.
		-  Often a tension (health) between PM asking for more and Eng saying no or not now.
		- It's often the Engineering Manager's job to say 'no'.
- Illegal to inapprpooriate things
	- Knowing the laws in your state and country 
- Sensitive discussions - open, yet protecting business interests, fairness, 
- De-escalating tensions between individuals
	- Understand motivation and emotions
	- Try to make sure goals are shared
	- Role play - example
- Tone 
	- Too passive, assertive, too aggressive 
	- The relationship is an employment/business one.  We will hopefully be friendly.  
	- This isn't a family, this is a team.
	- There are times when the conversation needs to be more direct.  
	- Too direct vs. too indirect.  It's sometimes more important to communicate clearly than to be polite or nice (e.g. like on a team on the field)
	- Some of this is knowing really what matters, where are you values, what'd bending vs. breaking.

# BIG OPEN QUESTIONS 

- Organizing the content/curriculum
- How to do role playing  - try out the manual method of "doit yourself with another"
- How/When to use skits  
- Intro
- Test lecture - 
	- naturally a lot of this is prescription
	- ideal with these can be prefaced with a story (success or failure) or parable or  	
- Test skits
- Test role play 
- Video setup

- Disclaimers (Bias and Situation) - 
Here's our backgrouns, you can see some of our biases, but not all; for sure we hv esome you will discover by hearing stories.  You'll hear our examples, mistakes, succes, and what we've learned from them.  Much of this stuff, there isn't one right way or real right answer.  There's always caountr examples and each situation is a bit dirferent - hopefully you can take some of ourexperience and use it as your own it.
